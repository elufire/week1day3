Run the app on an android emulator or phone. Click the button that says changetext when the app
opens up. The effect you should see is the text above changing to something random with every click.
The file MainActivity.java contains the methods for changing the text. The file activity_main.xml
contains the data on the android components, i.e buttons, text view. Screenshots are contained in
the com.example.rickb.week1day3 folder.
